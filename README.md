## Summary of Accomplishments

Through this rigorous 16-month journey, I acquired a diverse and impactful skill set spanning technical, analytical, and leadership domains. My capstone project with **Bath & Body Works (BBW)** and **A.T. Kearney** exemplified my ability to deliver AI-driven operational efficiencies, leveraging machine learning and advanced analytics to optimize sourcing and streamline workflows. These projects provided hands-on experience in working with complex business challenges, producing measurable and sustainable improvements.

The program emphasized hands-on application of theories, from building scalable distributed systems and crafting AI-powered machine learning solutions to analyzing financial models and managing disruptive technologies. I designed and launched innovative projects such as the **"Expired" app** to reduce food waste and a photo-tagging tool using computer vision, showcasing the intersection of sustainability and technology. 

Additionally, I honed product management capabilities by conducting market analyses, proposing product features for tools like Microsoft Copilot, and optimizing experimentation techniques with A/B testing. Each project deepened my understanding of bridging technical solutions with strategic business goals.

This experience has equipped me to lead in dynamic, tech-driven environments where innovation, collaboration, and data-driven insights shape impactful solutions. The programâ€™s integration of technical expertise with practical execution has prepared me to drive meaningful change and deliver measurable results across industries.
